# LeetCode 2811: Check if Array Splitting is Possible

## Problem Analysis

In this problem:

1. We have an array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `m`.
2. We need to determine if we can split the array into `n` non-empty subarrays through a series of operations.
3. A subarray is considered "good" if:
   - It has a length of 1, OR
   - The sum of its elements is greater than or equal to `m`.
4. In each operation, we can choose an existing array of length at least 2 and split it into 2 subarrays, with each resulting subarray being "good".

## Key Insight

Let's consider what this problem is really asking: can we split the original array all the way down to `n` individual elements (each of length 1)?

For arrays of length 1 or 2, the answer is trivially true:

- If n=1, we already have a single element array (no splits needed).
- If n=2, we can split it into two individual elements in one operation.

For arrays with more than 2 elements, we need to analyze if we can perform a valid series of splits. The crucial insight is that we need at least one adjacent pair of elements with a sum ≥ m to start the splitting process. If no such pair exists, it's impossible to create valid splits.

Why? Because if we can't split any pair of adjacent elements (which would be the basic building block), then we certainly can't split larger subarrays.

## Solution

```python
def canSplitArray(nums, m):
    n = len(nums)

    # For arrays of length 1 or 2, the answer is always True
    if n <= 2:
        return True

    # For arrays with more than 2 elements, check if any adjacent pair has sum >= m
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if nums[i] + nums[i + 1] >= m:
            return True

    return False
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once to check for adjacent pairs with a sum ≥ m.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

## Explanation with Example

Let's understand this with an example:

**Example**: nums = [2, 3, 3, 2, 3], m = 6

1. n = 5, which is > 2, so we check for adjacent pairs.
2. We find that 3 + 3 = 6, which is ≥ m.
3. This means we can start the splitting process:
   - We can split at this position: [2, 3], [3, 2, 3]
   - The first subarray [2, 3] has sum 5 < m, but since its length is 2, we can split it into [2], [3].
   - The second subarray [3, 2, 3] has sum 8 ≥ m, so it's "good". We can further split it.
4. We can continue this process until we have 5 individual elements.
5. Therefore, the answer is True.

The key is that if there's at least one adjacent pair with sum ≥ m, we can always find a valid sequence of splits to reach n individual elements.
