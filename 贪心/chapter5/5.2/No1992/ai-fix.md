Looking at your code for the "Find All Groups of Farmland" problem, I've identified a potential issue with the boundary checking in your while loops. Let's analyze and correct it:

## Code Analysis

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  vector<vector<int>> findFarmland(vector<vector<int>> &land) {
    int n = land.size(), m = land[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> res;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        if (land[i][j] == 0)
          continue;
        int sx = i, sy = j;
        int tx = i, ty = j;
        while (land[i][ty] && ty < m)
          ++ty;
        --ty;
        while (land[tx][ty] && tx < n)
          ++tx;
        --tx;
        res.push_back({sx, sy, tx, ty});
        for (int x = sx; x <= tx; x++)
          for (int y = sy; y <= ty; y++)
            land[x][y] = 0;
      }
    }
    return res;
  }
};
```

## Issue Identified

There's a potential out-of-bounds access in your while loops:

1. In `while (land[i][ty] && ty < m)` - If `ty` becomes equal to `m`, accessing `land[i][ty]` would be out of bounds since C++ evaluates the left part of the AND condition first.

2. Similarly, in `while (land[tx][ty] && tx < n)` - If `tx` becomes equal to `n`, there would be an out-of-bounds access.

## Corrected Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  vector<vector<int>> findFarmland(vector<vector<int>> &land) {
    int n = land.size(), m = land[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> res;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        if (land[i][j] == 0)
          continue;
        int sx = i, sy = j;
        int tx = i, ty = j;
        // Fix boundary check order
        while (ty < m && land[i][ty])
          ++ty;
        --ty;
        // Fix boundary check order
        while (tx < n && land[tx][ty])
          ++tx;
        --tx;
        res.push_back({sx, sy, tx, ty});
        for (int x = sx; x <= tx; x++)
          for (int y = sy; y <= ty; y++)
            land[x][y] = 0;
      }
    }
    return res;
  }
};
```

## Explanation

The algorithmic approach is correct:

1. Iterate through the matrix to find the top-left corner of a farm (a '1' cell)
2. Expand right to find the right boundary
3. Expand down to find the bottom boundary
4. Mark all cells in this farm group as visited (set to 0)
5. Continue to find all farm groups

The only change needed was to reorder the conditions in the while loops to check the boundary conditions first, which prevents potential out-of-bounds access.

Your approach is efficient and will correctly identify all rectangular farm groups in the matrix with the small fix I suggested.
